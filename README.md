<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project aims to develop a small handheld device capable of various functionalities related to 433MHz radio communication. The device allows for receiving, transmitting, copying, saving, and jamming signals within the 433MHz frequency range. Additionally, it features a 128x64 I2C OLED screen and six buttons, four for navigation and two for confirming and canceling actions.

F_Light stands for Free Light.

To see the prototype PCB go to **[this](https://github.com/Flee-Time/F_Light_PCB)** repo.

To see my workflow go to **[this](https://trello.com/b/z0zgr5WM)** Trello board.

* At its current stage of development, the project has made significant progress on the UI implementation. The RF section and the SD Card & FileSystem support, is currently in progress and being actively worked on.

## Key Features

* **433MHz Communication:** The device is designed to work within the 433MHz frequency range, enabling it to interact with a variety of radio devices operating on this frequency.
* **Receiving:** The device can receive signals transmitted by other 433MHz devices, allowing users to monitor and analyze the data being transmitted.
* **Transmitting:** Users can utilize the device to transmit signals to other 433MHz devices, facilitating the communication between the handheld device and compatible devices.
* **Copying:** The device offers the ability to copy received signals, allowing users to replicate and retransmit the same signal multiple times.
* **Saving:** Users can save received signals for later analysis or retransmission, providing a convenient storage mechanism for important or interesting data.
* **Jamming:** The device includes a jamming functionality, which can be used to disrupt or interfere with the signals of other nearby 433MHz devices.


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This guide will get you setup your basic development enviroment, building and running is quite simple with the PlatformIO extension.

### Prerequisites

Theres only one prerequisite right now.
* PlatformIO extension for Visual Studio Code

### Building

This is the bare minimum you have to do to get the project running on bare metal.

1. Clone the repo.
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Flee-Time/F_Light.git
   ```
2. Open the cloned project in VS Code with PlatformIO.
<br>

3. _(Optional)_ Change the `platormio.ini` file to suit your prefered upload and debug method.
    ```ini
    upload_protocol = stlink
    debug_tool = stlink
    ```

4. Build and upload under the `genericSTM32F411CE/General` project tasks using the PlatformIO extension.


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Pinouts and Connection Diagrams

This project utilizes a combination of hardware components to create a versatile handheld radio device.

* Hardware used in this project
```
STLink clone
STM32F411CEU6 BLACK PILL / WeAct Black Pill V2.0
Fake SSD1306 1.3" OLED Display (Has a sh1106 controller inside)
CC1101 433MHz module
6 Buttons
```

To properly connect the various components of the handheld device, the following pin connections should be made:

* Buttons
```
3v3  --> all_buttons
PB12 --> up_button
PB13 --> right_button
PB14 --> down_button
PB15 --> left_button
PA8  --> back_button
PA9  --> action_button
```

* OLED Display (SSD1306/SH1106)
```
PB6 --> SCL
PB7 --> SDA
3v3 --> VCC
GND --> GND
```

* ST-Link Debugger
```
PA13 --> SWDIO
PA14 --> SWCLK
3v3  --> 3v3
GND  --> GND
```

* RTC Battery
```
VBAT --> CR2032_Plus
GND  --> CR2032_Minus
```

* RF Section (CC1101)
```
PB0 --> GD0
PA7 --> MOSI
PA6 --> MISO
PA5 --> SCK
PA4 --> CS
```

* SD Card Module
```
PA7 --> MOSI
PA6 --> MISO
PA5 --> SCK
PA3 --> CS
```
